<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Herman Akwiri,a passionate and detail-oriented Full-Stack Developer with 1 year of experience building responsive, user-friendly,
   and efficient web applications. I thrive on translating complex problems into elegant code, managing everything from robust backend logic to intuitive front-end interfaces.

<p>My expertise spans the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), with a strong command of JavaScript Python, and SQL/NoSQL databases.
  I am a perpetual learner, always eager to explore new technologies and contribute to open-source projects. When I'm not coding,
   you can find me hiking or experimenting with data visualization tools.

<p>I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills to a forward-thinking team. You can view my source code on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn".
   When I'm not designing, you can find me hiking or sketching in my local park. View my work samples or connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss potential opportunities"
